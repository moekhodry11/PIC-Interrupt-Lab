# PIC16F877A-Interrupt-Lab
 This repository contains code and documentation for a lab project on interrupt programming using the PIC16F877A microcontroller and the mikroC IDE.
 
 
# Getting started
To run the code in this repository, you will need the following:

- A PIC16F877A microcontroller
- A programmer (such as a PICkit or ICD3)
- The mikroC IDE (available from mikroC website)
- A breadboard and other basic electronic components (such as LEDs and resistors)

Once you have these items, you can clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/moekhodry11/PIC-Interrupt-Lab.git
```

# Contents
This repository contains several example programs that demonstrate different types of interrupts in the PIC16F877A microcontroller. Each program is located in a separate folder and includes a README file that explains how it works.

The following programs are included:

-External_Interrupt: Demonstrates how to use an external interrupt to detect a button press and toggle an LED.
